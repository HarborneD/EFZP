#EFZP
An acronym for Email Functional Zone Parser

###The idea

It turns this:

```
"Hi Dave,\nLets meet up this Tuesday\nCheers, Tom\n\nOn Sunday, 15 May 2011 at 5:02 PM, Dave Trindall wrote: Hey Tom,\nHow about we get together ..."
```

into this:

```
{
	"Salutation": "Hi Dave,\n"
	"Body": "Lets meet up this Tuesday\n"
	"Signature": "Cheers, Tom\n\n"
	"Reply Text": "On Sunday, 15 May 2011 at 5:02 PM, Dave Trindall wrote: ..."
}
```

##Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Trindaz/EFZP.git
```

or just download [EFZP.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Trindaz/EFZP/master/EFZP.py)

##Usage

This python script

```python
import EFZP as zp
p = zp.parse("Hi Dave,\nLets meet up this Tuesday\nCheers, Tom\n\nOn Sunday, 15 May 2011 at 5:02 PM, Dave Trindall wrote: Hey Tom,\nHow about we get together ...")
print p

```

prints this

```
{'salutation': 'Hi Dave,\n', 'body': 'Lets meet up this Tuesday\n', 'reply_text': 'On Sunday, 15 May 2011 at 5:02 PM, Dave Trindall wrote: Hey Tom,\nHow about we get together ...', 'signature': 'Cheers, Tom\n\n'}
```
